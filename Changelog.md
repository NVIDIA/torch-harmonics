# Changelog

## Versioning

### v0.8.1

* Revised the truncation logic for the SHT
* Restructuring torch-harmonics module to streamline usage of the new attention and DISCO layers
* Full PyTorch 2 custom operator compatibility, allowing for exporting models with torch-harmonics layers using torch.export
* Added OpenMP accelerated CPU backend for DISCO and attention layers
* New query functions `torch_harmonics.disco.optimized_kernels_is_available` and `torch_harmonics.attention.optimized_kernels_is_available` for optimized layers availability
* More tests for DISCO and attention layers
* Cleaned up notebooks

### v0.8.0

* Adding spherical attention and spherical neighborhood attention
* Custom CUDA kerneles for spherical neighborhood attention
* New datasets for segmentation and depth estimation on the sphere based on the 2D3DS dataset
* added new spherical architectures and corresponding baselines
    * S2 Transformer
    * S2 Segformer
    * S2 U-Net

### v0.7.6

* Adding cache for precomoputed tensors such as weight tensors for DISCO and SHT
* Cache is returning copies of tensors and not references. Users are still encouraged to re-use
  those tensors manually in their models because this will also save memory. However,
  the cache will help with model setup speed.
* Adding test which ensures that cache is working correctly
