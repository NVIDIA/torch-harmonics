# Changelog

## Versioning

### v0.7.3

* Changing default grid in all SHT routines to `equiangular`

### v0.7.2

* Added resampling modules for convenience
* Changing behavior of distributed SHT to use `dim=-3` as channel dimension

* Changing the way custom CUDA extensions are handled

### v0.7.1

* Hotfix to AMP in SFNO example

### v0.7.0

* CUDA-accelerated DISCO convolutions
* Updated DISCO convolutions to support even number of collocation points across the diameter
